    "\n",
    "These are notes and resources exploring business development, data science, computer science, and engineering as a whole. Since I never went to college, this is an effort to attain a deep understanding of graduate level concepts and improve my development skills as well as provide a basis for any of my projects using Python. I will try to exercise legitimate academic rigor in this repository, referencing and including relevant papers where appropriate.\n",

    "My workflow here focuses on Python 3 and Jupyer notebooks containing extensive [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) notes. I have also included an extensive curriculum in this repository for self-study along with notes which I will revisit, edit, and expand upon as I see fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be using data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) and the [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/) for examples. Purely as an exercise, data will be downloaded as needed and not included in the repository. Thus, it is possible that examples may break in the future. Please open issues if missing data becomes a problem. Executable demonstrations outside of Jupyter Notebooks will include Dockerfiles so that they may be easily reproduced.\n",

    "\n",
    "## An emergent space\n",
    "\n",
    "The tooling and methodology in the open source community is constantly evolving and the best design patterns are still yet to be determined. The landscape is constantly evolving, and there are so many problem spaces that one size cannot possibly fit all. I aspire to explore many approaches in this repository, although the *focus is on Python tooling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will (eventually) attempt to describe an environment for collaborative development and data science that I see fit for self-hosted commercial usage and production deployment. I feel that [TensorFlow](tensorflow.org) is an emerging machine learning standard and a very useful tool for rapidly testing and visualizing models. My focus is on [TensorFlow Serving](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/architecture_overview) for production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a data scientist?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.*\" --Richard Hamming, 1961\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Hilary Mason definition, data science is three fundamentally different things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Math - having a theoretical understanding\n",
    "2. Code - implementing ideas in code\n",
    "3. Communication - telling stories about the data you work with\n",
    "\n",
    "And I would add...\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never\n",
    "expected to see.*\" --John Tukey\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreso than being a pure mathematician or programmer, data science is about\n",
    "framing the data in such a way that you can attain useful insights about it and\n",
    "determine what questions to ask of it. Visualization is a powerful tool to \n",
    "achieve this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte is a canonical resource for creating useful visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the problem we are really trying to solve?\n",
    "2. How do we know when we've won? What are the error metrics for success?\n",
    "3. Assuming we've solved this perfectly, what is the first thing we'll do?\n",
    "4. How impactful is this? Does it matter?\n",
    "5. What is the most evil thing that can be done with this?\n",
    "6. Where do I begin?\n",
    "    1. What data *do* we have?\n",
    "    2. What data **should** we have?\n",
    "    3. What **assumptions** do I make that I can experimentally verify?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't use data to replace intuition, you use data to enhance your\n",
    "intuition. Take the assumptions you make, validate them, and act upon them.\n",
    "Have metrics meetings. Have multiple people agree on what action they will take\n",
    "based on your data. Don't follow data blindly, people have followed GPS into\n",
    "lakes. We cannot trust technology over our brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good people are much better than good tools. So what does technology offer?\n",
    "\n",
    "We must identify things which are becoming possible but have not yet been\n",
    "commoditized. The technology landscape is changing very quickly. Data science \n",
    "- R&D - needs to be integrated into our applications. Artificial intelligence is\n",
    "anything that a computer cannot do today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language generation is an emergent field - taking large volumes of\n",
    "structured data and producing human readable content.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're beginning to see much more data from the real world. Many people call this\n",
    "the internet of things. It's become very cheap to generate data from physical\n",
    "reality. Realtime answers are increasingly important, although the definition of\n",
    "\"realtime\" is nebulous. It could mean seconds and it could mean days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of world does our technology enable?\n",
    "\n",
    "With possibly billions of people using a product, we have the potential to \n",
    "actually alter human behavior. Data gives us superpowers. The biggest opportunities could be very surprising. Startups are taking commodity technology and combining it in new ways, but they don't tend to have much  data. Improving existing processes has a constrained upside - the value proposition is easier to articulate, but you can only reduce an already sunk cost for a potential customer.\n",
