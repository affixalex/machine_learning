# Passer - A Python Task Queuing Library

This is an implementation of [Sparrow](https://github.com/radlab/sparrow) using
Python 3 and [grpc](http://www.grpc.io/) instead of Java and Swift. 

The [Motivation and Design Principles](http://www.grpc.io/posts/principles) of 
gRPC is also a great resource to help understand many aspects of this system.
