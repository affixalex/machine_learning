    "# Comprehensions in Python the Jedi way\n",

    "> Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",

    "With respect and thanks to [the original author](https://gist.github.com/bearfrieze/a746c6f12d8bada03589), this is here for my further experimentation and expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "I frequently deal with collections of things in the programs I write. Collections of droids, jedis, planets, lightsabers, starfighters, etc. When programming in Python, these collections of things are usually represented as lists, sets and dictionaries. Oftentimes, what I want to do with collections is to transform them in various ways. Comprehensions is a powerful syntax for doing just that. I use them extensively, and it's one of the things that keep me coming back to Python. Let me show you a few examples of the incredible usefulness of comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the tasks presented in the examples can be accomplished with the extensive standard library available in Python. These solutions would arguably be more terse and efficient in some cases. I don't have anything against the standard library. To me there is a certain elegance and beauty in the explicit nature of comprehensions. Everything you need to know is right there in the code in a concise and readable form – no need to dig through the docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: I'm using Python 3.5. List, set, and dictionary comprehensions are available in Python 2.7 and above, but the functions and syntax used in the examples might not be available/valid for other versions of Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "Can we do better than this? Of course we can! Take a look at this functional approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "octets = list(map(lambda i: bbs[i:i+8], range(0, len(bbs), 8)))\n",
    "```\n",

    "We [`map`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) the indexes of the octets to a lambda function that return an octet starting at that index. The `map` function returns an iterable which we turn into a list with the [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list) function. This is slightly more concise than the imperative approach, but arguably less readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decide to ask master Yoda for advice. He suggests the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "octets = [bbs[i:i+8] for i in range(0, len(bbs), 8)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, is that the force? Nope, that right there is a comprehension. A list comprehension to be more exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brackets `[]`  indicate that we are making a new list. Inside the brackets we first have an expression: `bbs[i:i+8]`. Next up is a `for` clause: `for i in range(0, len(bbs), 8)`. The `for` clause defines the iterator that we use as a basis for our new list, and the initial expression defines the resulting element in the new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bonus info: The stuff inside the brackets is called a [generator expression](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/) and can be used on it's own to create iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what a list comprehension is, we can use it again to turn the octets into characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chrs = [chr(int(octet, 2)) for octet in octets]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['s', ' ', 'n', 'o', ' ', ' ', 'i', ' ', 's', 'n', ' ', 'e', ' ', ' ', 'h', ' ', ' ', 'e', ' ', 'r', ' ', ' ', 'p', 'm', ' ', 'o', ' ', 'c']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, that looks promising, but it's still kind of fragmented. What if we removed the spaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally we would [`filter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter) out all the `' '` characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chrs = list(filter(lambda c: c is not ' ', chrs))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That would work, but now that we know the true power of the comprehension, we can simply do this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chrs = [c for c in chrs if c is not ' ']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `if` clauses in our list comprehensions to perform a filtering operations. Neat!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we join up the letters into a string to make the message more readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = ''.join(chrs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Err, what is a \"snoisneherpmoc\"? Maybe R2-D2 spoke the message in reverse for some reason.\n",

    "\n",
    "We could use [`itertools.combinations`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations) to do this, but for now let's imagine it doesn't exist and that we have to write our own code for once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start out by creating a list of all the possible permutations of 2 droids the old school way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matches = []\n",
    "for i in range(len(droids)):\n",
    "  for j in range(i + 1, len(droids)):\n",
    "    matches.append((droids[i], droids[j]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make that a little nicer if we use the built in [`enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) function and some list slicing:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "matches = []\n",
    "for i, a in enumerate(droids):\n",
    "  for b in droids[i + 1:]:\n",
    "    matches.append((a, b))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That can be turned into a cute one liner with a nested list comprehension (yes, you can nest them!):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matches = [(a, b) for i, a in enumerate(droids) for b in droids[i + 1:]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we might want to score these matches based on whether the droids share a favourite jedi. This just happens to be really easy to do with an inline conditional expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scores = ['Great' if a['fav_jedi'] == b['fav_jedi'] else 'Miserable' for a, b in matches]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's zip the matches with the scores and print them in a nice and readable format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(['{[name]} + {[name]} = {}'.format(*m, s) for m, s in zip(matches, scores)])\n",
