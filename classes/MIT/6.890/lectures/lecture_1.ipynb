    "$P$ = Problems that can be solved in $n^O(i)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential time\n",
    "\n",
    "$EXP$ = Problems that can be solved in $n^i$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite time\n",
    "\n",
    "And $F$ - can we just call this $i$ time? \n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial vs. Exponential time is the most common question. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Deterministic Polynomial Time\n",
    "\n",
    "$NP$ = Decision problems that are solvable via a \"*lucky*\" algorithm. Let's say that it just guesses, and then says yes or no.. but guesses are garanteed to always lead to a YES outcome if possible. CoNP is the opposite - just flip yes and no.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of it...\n",
    "\n",
    "$NP$ = Decision problems with solutions that can be \"checked\" in polynomial time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky algorithms can be converted into checking algorithms and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P=NP?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you say $P\\neq NP$ you are essentially saying that luck cannot be engineered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I'm not sure that's true. I think $P=NP$ might be true.\n",

    "\n",
    "**X-Hard** = \"At least as hard as every problem $\\in X$\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**X-Complete** = Just the logical AND of two things... being X-hard and being in X. So, an X-Complete problem is X-Hard $\\land \\in X$\n",
    "\n",
    "**PSPACE** = Problems solvable in polynomial space. Generally, problems that are solvable in PSPACE are solvable in EXP time because there are only EXP-many states in the machine."
