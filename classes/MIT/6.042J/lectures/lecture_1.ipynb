    "# Lecture 1 - Proofs, Propositions, and Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a proof?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A proof is a method for establishing the truth**. Proofs is not limited to mathematics - proofs are used everywhere in business and in society. Exeriments and observation are the bedrocks of ascertaining truths across disciplines, not just in science and math. \n",
    "\n",
    "Truth is the opposite of falsehood, so how do we establish falsehood? **Find counter-examples**. If you do an experiment 10 times and always get the same results, you have found a truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about more subjective truths? How do we decide if Roger Clemens is guilty of lying about steroids to congress? Truth is established by juries and judges. What are truths beyond judges and juries? **Religion**. Religion is really hard to argue about... because you believe it. If you aren't talking to God regularly and someone else is, it's hard to argue with them about it. This gets complicated because you can end up with conflicting truths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many arguments in computer science are tantamount to religious arguments. The great thing about mathematics is that everything can be proven, the youngest person can successfully argue against the oldest. **A mathematical proof is the verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms.** The important parts are...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Propositions\n",
    "2. Deductions\n",
    "3. Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Propositions\n",
    "\n",
    "**A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example...\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2+3=5$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "That is obviously a true proposition. Here's a more interesting example...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall n \\in N$, $n^2+n+41$ is a prime number given $N$ is the set of all natural numbers, e.g., all whole numbers which are not negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part, $\\forall n \\in N^+$, is called a **quantifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The quantifier determines the universe of discourse.** We're only taking about natural numbers, \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part, \"$n^2+n+41$ is a prime number\" is called a **predicate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of a variable.** In this case, $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to see if this proposition is true, we need to see if the predicate is true for every natural number $n$. This particular example is interesting, because the first 40 (0 to 39) examples work, and *then* it fails. So **this proposition is false**. For it to be true, the predicate would have to work on all natural numbers $n$ in $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example proposition...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "$a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4$ has no positive integer solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposition was conjectured to be true by Oiler in 1769. Oiler is a big honcho in math, and we still talk about him a lot even though he's been dead for centuries. This proposition was unsolved for over 2 centuries! Here's how it was disproved\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = 95,800$$\n",
    "$$b = 217,519$$\n",
    "$$c = 414,560$$\n",
    "$$d = 422,481$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Apparently, this disproves the proposition! Whatever. A true proposition is...\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\exists a,b,c,d \\in N^+, a^4+b^4+c^4 = d^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "$313(x^3,y^3)=z^3$ has no positive integer solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be false. But the shortest, smallest counter-example has over a thousand digits. Why would you care if this even has a solution? Why would anyone even try to find a solution? Actually, in this case that's really practically important.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is an example of an elliptic curve. It's essential to the understanding of how to factor large integers. Who cares about factoring? Factoring is the way to break crypto systems like RSA which are used electronically for everything we do today. If you can find solutions to problems like this, you can get an edge in factoring and potentially break cryptography systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**The regions in any map can be colored in 4 colors so that all adjacent regions have different colors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the *four color theorem* and it's very famous in the popular literature. It has a long history, it was conjectured by someone named Guthrey in 1853. There were many false proofs over the ensuring century, many of them using pictures. **Proofs by picture are often compelling, and often wrong**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every even integer but 2 is the sum of two primes**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 24 is the sum of 11 and 13. This is called **Goldbach's Conjecture**. People still don't know if it's true. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 6\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\forall n \\in Z, n \\geq Z \\implies n^2 \\geq 4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What is does the symbol $\\implies$ mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "**An implication $p \\implies q$ is said to be true if p is false or q is true.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\forall n \\in Z, n \\geq z \\iff n^2 \\geq 4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $n$ in $Z$, $n$ >= $z$ if and only if $n^2$ >= 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is just to get better at reading mathematical notation rather than proving anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "An axiom is just a proposition that is assumed to be true. There is not necessarily any proof that an axiom is true, you just assume it because you think it is reasonable. You have to make assumptions to do math, or else you can't prove anything. The key in math is to identify what your assumptions are so that people can see them. The idea is, when you do a proof anyone who agrees with your axioms can follow your proof. They might disagree with your axioms in which case they aren't going to accept your proof. \n",
    "\n",
    "Axioms can be contradictory in different contexts. In euclidean geometry, there is an axiom that says given a line L and and a point P not on L, there is exactly one line through P parallel to L. There is also a field called spherical geometry, and there you have an axiom that contradicts this. It was given a line L and a point P not on L, there is NO line through P parallel to L. There is a field called hyperbolic geometry, and there is an axiom there that says given a line L and a point P there are *infinitely* many lines through P parallel to L.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different axioms make sense in different contexts. You can have whatever axioms you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two guiding principles to axioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axioms should be consistent and complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set of axioms is said to be consistent if no proposition can be proved to be both true and false.\n",
    "2. A set of axioms is said to be complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is either true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd think that it wouldn't be hard to get a set of axioms that meet these two standards, but it turns out to not be so easy. "
