# The Paradigm Shift from Producer to User Innovation

## Traditional Manufacturer Centered Innovation

Manufacturers identify user needs, develop products at private expense, and 
profit by protecting and selling what they have developed.

## User-Centered (Democratized) Innovation

Lead Users innovate to solve their own needs at private expense and then freely 
reveal their innovations.

## Peer-to-peer Diffusion vs. Market Diffusion

A project that is huge gets divided up amongst users, and you can do big things.
Collaborative users are becoming viable across more of the opportunity space.
As design costs come down, the individual is capable of more.
