    "### Models of Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Pointer Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point, and the one being used in this lecture, is called the [pointer machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_machine). It's an old one, from the 80s. It corresponds to what you might think about if you've done a lot of object oriented programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have a bunch of nodes... they have a constant number of fields in them. You can think of these as objects or structs in C. Each field could be a pointer to another node or it could be a null pointer, or it could have some data in it. You can have a pointer to yourself, or a pointer back to the record which pointed at you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of this as the memory model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the computation part of the model. You can use it to create new nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = new node\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can look at fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = y.field\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can set fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x.field = y\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can compute on data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = y + z\n",
    "    x = z - y\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is more about how everything is organized in memory and not so much about what you're allowed to do to the data items. In this lecture, it won't matter what you're doing to the data items. We'll never touch them, we just copy them around. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is going to be one node in your data structure, or in memory, called the **root node**. You're always working relative to the root node. You can manipulate all nodes via the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many data structures, particularly classic data structures, follow a pointer machine model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What we'd like to do is transform that data structure and make a new pointer machine data structure that does extra cool things. Namely, travel through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Temporal Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.) Persistence\n",
    "Lecture one covers persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistence is the branching universe time travel model, where if you make a change in the past you get a new universe. You never destroy old universes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.) Retroactivity\n",
    "Lecture two covers retroactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retroactivity is more like Back to The Future. You can go back and make a change, then return to the present and see what happened. This is much harder to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "The general goal of persistence is to remember everything. And by everything, I mean different versions of the data structure. Data structures in general have update operations and query operations, we're mainly concerned about updates here. Every time you do an update, you can think of it as taking a version of the data structure and making a new one. You never want to destroy old versions. Even though an operation such as an insert may change a data structure, we want to remember the past state as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data structure operations are relative to a specified version. An update creates and returns a new version. So when you do an update, you specify a version of the data structure and the data you want to insert... and the output is a new version. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Levels of Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.) Partial Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the easiest to obtain. In partial persistence, you are only allowed to update the latest version. This means that versions are linearly ordered. What this allows is looking back at old versions and querying them, but you cannot change them - you can only change the most recent version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.) Full Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "In full persistence, you can look back and update any version you want. The versions, then, form a tree. Updating a previous version creates a new branch of the tree, and any version can be branched. This is why it is called the branching universe model. When you update, you branch. No version ever gets destroyed and you can query all versions, but unlike partial persistence you can also update any version, which returns a new version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.) Confluent Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "In confluent persistence, you can combine two versions. \n",
    "\n",
